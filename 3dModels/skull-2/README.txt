Hollow-ish Skull by Cynnewulf on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2596157

Summary:
I took the excellent simplified human skull from "To Make or not to Make", and sort of hollowed it out in Tinkercad. The majority of the cranium is hollow, and I bored a hole in the base and the back of the eye sockets. I have a bunch of cheap LED tea lights, I'm planning on lighting this up with one of those.  My first test print, my support failed (I was using PVA on the second nozzel, but it seems to have jammed), and I can see that the hollow cylinders I placed in the eye sockets do not go all the way into the cranium hollow... so, I have added a second file called "Hollowish Skull with cheek support" which includes an attempt at adding cheek support and I extended the hollow cylinders enough to actually penetrate the remaining 13 mm into the cranium.  I have not yet printed this second version, nor have I quite finished my first print as of this posting.Files:Hollowish Skull: "To Make or Not To Make" with hollow cranium, hole in base, and 20 mm deep eye socket extensions (you can put lights in there or really small cats, or something.) they are 13 mm short of actually penetrating into the hollow area.Hollowish Skull with Cheek Support: Skull with empty cranium, hole through base, and eye sockets bored through into the empty cranium, plus pencil-like cheek bone supports.Hollow Skull v2: Skull with empty cranium, hole through base, and eye sockets actually bored through into the empty cranium.This is a work in progress.
